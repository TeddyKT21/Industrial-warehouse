# Industrial-warehouse
A C# console app that manages a state of a virtual warehouse with high computational efficiency.
In the project I use the SortedDictionary and SortedSet classes from .net to optimize performance when preforming actions in the warehouse
when running, the user can preform action trough a console interface, including: remove a single box, 
remove multiple boxes, add boxes to the warehouse, and check the boxes stored in the warehouse. The warehouse also removes inactive box sizes after a given period.
